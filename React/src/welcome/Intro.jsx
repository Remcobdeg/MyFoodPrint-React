                                Our diets make up about 30% of our carbon footprint. 
                                Improving diet choices is important for reducing our carbon footprint. 
                                It's even crucial to achieve the COP goals of limiting global warming to +1.5Â°

                                Looking at the size and color, you can see where the most gain can be made for reducing your foodprint. 
                                Each word represents a type of food/drink, like <em>apples</em>. 
                                The larger the word, the higher the total foodprint from the amount of products you bought from that category. 
                                The app then uses that information to show you the relative footprint of your choices. <br/>
                                A database is then searched for information on the products. <br/>
                                The app uses that information to create a wordcloud that reflects the foodprint of the items on your scanned receipt. <br/>

                                Each word represents a type of food on your receipt (e.g. peanut butter). Traffic light color coding signals the foodprint per 100g of the product, similar to the color coding on food packages signalling fat and sugar concentrations. Dark red signals the highest concentration of foodprint per 100g. 
                                The size of a word reflects the relative impact of this product on your footprint. The larger the word, the bigger the impact 
                                There are two ways that a word can 
                                Buying a lot of a product something that has a high foodprint(?) per 100g or buying lots of a product both contribute to the foodprint of this product in this overview.
